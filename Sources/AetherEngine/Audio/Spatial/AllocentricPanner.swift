/// Dual-balance panning, the scheme ITU-R BS.2127 specifies for Cartesian ("allocentric") objects
/// and the one Atmos home renderers are built around: the room is a stack of speaker planes (floor,
/// ceiling), each plane a set of rows front to back, each row a set of speakers left to right.
/// A position is balanced between the two planes that bracket its height, then inside each plane
/// between the two rows that bracket its depth, then inside each row between the two speakers that
/// bracket its width. Every balance is constant-power, so the result always has unit power and an
/// object moving across the room never changes loudness.
///
/// Rows and planes are whatever the layout has: a 7.1.2 ceiling is one row, a 5.1 floor has no
/// side row, and a bed with no ceiling at all folds every height onto the floor, which is what a
/// renderer is supposed to do with height content it has nowhere to put.
